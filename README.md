# Development and implementation of a numerical simulation system for analyzing the thermal-hydraulic (T-H) characteristics of the MNSR research reactor fuel assembly

# Abstract
In this study, a numerical simulation system was developed using Python and MATLAB programming languages to analyze the Thermal-Hydraulic (T-H) characteristics of the fuel assembly in the MNSR reactor. Our research aims to address a critical problem in nuclear reactor operation: understanding and optimizing the temperature distribution in the fuel assembly. This is essential for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the reactor, as it helps maintain the reactor within its operational limits and prevents the risks of overheating or insufficient cooling. The simulation system employs the Finite Volume Method to discretize the governing equations for fluid mechanics and heat transfer, enabling the prediction of the temperature distribution in both radial and axial cases. The system also takes into account the effects of power distribution, fuel burnup, and coolant flow rate on the temperature distribution. The case study was performed on the fuel assembly and compared the simulation systemâ€™s results with those obtained using the PARET/ANL code. The temperature profile in the axial direction showed that the coolant temperature increased continuously from the inlet value of 24.0 degrees Celsius to the outlet value of 70.0 degrees Celsius. The comparison indicates that the simulation system provides accurate and reliable predictions of the thermal-hydraulic (T-H) behavior of the fuel assembly. Furthermore, the developed numerical simulation system offers a valuable tool for analyzing the T-H characteristics of fuel assemblies in research reactors, which can be applied to other kinds of nuclear research reactors to help optimize their design and operation. The results of this study have broader implications for the nuclear industry and demonstrate the effectiveness of using Python and MATLAB to develop simulation systems for predicting the thermohydraulic behavior of fuel assemblies in research reactors.
